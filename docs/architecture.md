# Photon architecture

Photon is a Swift 6 menu-bar agent (`LSUIElement`, bundle id `com.ryanstoffel.photon`) built with SwiftPM. There is no committed Xcode project. `Scripts/package_app.sh` wraps the `Photon` executable in `Photon.app`.

Deployment target: macOS 14+. Newer materials (`NSGlassEffectView` / Liquid Glass) are used at runtime when the class exists; GitHub Actions `macos-latest` logs `sw_vers` and the SDK in the `lint` and `smoke` jobs. See [macos-runners.md](macos-runners.md).

`Package.swift` only adds the AppKit modules and the `Photon` executable when `os(macOS)` is true. `PhotonCore` compiles everywhere. `PhotonClipboard` is also declared for every platform: its AppKit files are wrapped in `#if canImport(AppKit)`, so the models, history rules, search, and store build and test on Linux while the monitor, paster, and views only compile on macOS.

| Module | Depends on | Imports AppKit? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PhotonCore | -- | no |
| PhotonApps | PhotonCore | yes |
| PhotonClipboard | PhotonCore | partly (guarded) |
| PhotonNotes | PhotonCore | yes (AppKit panel, SwiftUI overlays) |
| PhotonFiles | PhotonCore | yes (plus QuickLookUI) |
| PhotonKeybinds | PhotonCore | yes (plus ApplicationServices, CoreGraphics, IOKit) |
| PhotonCalculator | PhotonCore | partly (pasteboard copy guarded) |
| Photon | all of the above | yes |

## How a provider plugs in

A provider is a `CommandProvider`:

```swift
public protocol CommandProvider: Sendable {
  var id: String { get }
  var displayName: String { get }
  func reload() async
  func commands(matching query: String) async -> [Command]
  func execute(_ command: Command) async throws
}
```

`Command` is a value type (`id`, `title`, `subtitle`, `keywords`, `providerID`, optional `icon`). Providers own how they find and run things. The launcher only searches and dispatches.

`icon` is a `CommandIcon`: the Finder icon of a path (`.fileIcon`), an image file (`.imageFile`), an application by bundle id (`.application`), a named image in a bundle or its asset catalog (`.bundleResource`), or an SF Symbol (`.symbol`). It stays a plain value so `PhotonCore` needs no AppKit; `Sources/Photon/Launcher/CommandIconCache.swift` resolves and caches the `NSImage`s (`NSWorkspace.icon(forFile:)`, `NSImage(contentsOfFile:)`, `urlForApplication(withBundleIdentifier:)`) and is warmed in the background once the providers have loaded. Apps use their bundle's Finder icon; System Settings panes go through `PaneIconPolicy` (`PhotonApps`), which reads the pane's declared icon (`NSPrefPaneIconFile`, `CFBundleIconFile`, or an asset catalog entry) and falls back to the System Settings app icon.

To add a Phase 2 feature:

1. Put the implementation in that feature's module (`Sources/PhotonNotes/`, …). Do not grow `PhotonApps` or dump logic into `PhotonCore`.
2. Conform to `CommandProvider`. Use `FuzzyMatcher` and `FrecencyStore` from PhotonCore if the feature is searchable.
3. Register the provider in `Sources/Photon/AppRuntime.swift` only:

   ```swift
   registry.register(NotesProvider())
   ```

4. Bind settings for that feature to `SettingsStore` and replace the placeholder tab in `SettingsRootView`. Leave other tabs alone.

The registry is a list. Search asks every provider for `commands(matching:)`, scores titles with `FuzzyMatcher`, and boosts ids that `FrecencyStore` has seen. Enter calls `execute` on the provider that owns the selected command, then records the id in frecency.

Shared files that every feature touches today:

- `Sources/Photon/AppRuntime.swift` — one `register` line
- `Sources/Photon/Settings/SettingsStore.swift` — new `@AppStorage` keys if needed
- `Sources/Photon/Settings/SettingsRootView.swift` — swap a placeholder tab

Avoid editing `Command.swift` or `CommandRegistry.swift` unless the protocol itself is insufficient. Prefer a new file in your module.

### Launcher sessions and modes

Clipboard history is a `LauncherSession.clipboard` beside the command list: same search field, its own view model, prefix (`cb ` / `clipboard `), and keys. File search uses a generic `LauncherMode` protocol (`Sources/Photon/Launcher/LauncherMode.swift`): typed prefixes (`/`, `f `), an activation command id, and optional inline results after the primary list. While a mode is active the launcher labels the footer corner (not the search field), renders `makeResultsView()`, and forwards leftover keys to `handle(_:)`. Escape or Backspace on an empty query leaves the session or mode; a second Escape hides the launcher. A mode reaches back through `LauncherModeHost` (focus, dismiss, activate the app for an auxiliary panel).

Register a mode next to the provider: `launcher.register(mode:)`. Clipboard still uses `attachClipboard` rather than this hook; a chore issue tracks unifying the two.

## File search (PhotonFiles)

Pipeline, all off the main thread except the final publish:

1. `SpotlightQueryBuilder` turns the typed text into a raw Spotlight query string (`kMDItemDisplayName == "*term*"cd || kMDItemFSName == ...`; every alphanumeric term must match; underscores and punctuation split terms so `ember_individual` is `ember` AND `individual`; terms shorter than three characters only match word prefixes; `kMDItemTextContent` is added when "search file contents" is on).
2. `FileSearchEngine` (main actor) debounces 120 ms, cancels the in-flight query, and runs `MdfindQueryRunner`: one `/usr/bin/mdfind -onlyin $HOME` (plus extra folders; omitted for **This Mac**) with `-0` null-terminated paths. Up to `max(500, 20 x limit)` hits become `FileResult` values via `FileResultFactory`. This is the same Spotlight/`mdfind` path Raycast uses; the engine does not walk the filesystem.
3. `FileRanker` scores name relevance (exact > prefix > word start > substring > file name > content), drops user-excluded folders and blocked system paths (`/System`, `/Library` except `~/Library`, `/private`, `/usr`, `/bin`) after resolving `/System/Volumes/Data` firmlinks, dedupes, sorts by relevance, last-used, modified, name, and caps at the configured limit. `FileIconCache` prefetches Finder icons before results are published so rows never pop.
4. `FileSearchController` publishes results and owns selection, Quick Look (`QuickLookCoordinator`, `QLPreviewPanel` data source found through the launcher panel's responder chain), and actions (`FileActions`: open, reveal, copy path). Empty Files mode stays a compact search field until the user types. `FileSearchView` renders rows (icon, name, middle-truncated parent path, kind), the `Cmd+I` info strip, and the key hints.

`FilesProvider` contributes the *Search Files* command and, for queries of three or more characters, up to three strong name matches to the default list. It never blocks `CommandRegistry.search`: it returns what is cached for the exact query and otherwise starts a background search that asks the launcher to refresh when it finishes.

Spotlight privacy exclusions apply automatically because Spotlight never indexes them. Default scope is the user home folder (`mdfind -onlyin $HOME`); **This Mac** remains available in settings. `FileRanker` re-sorts Spotlight hits with launcher-style fuzzy matching on the stem, file name, and path relative to home (separator-insensitive). Paths shown in the UI abbreviate firmlink prefixes (`/System/Volumes/Data/...`) to `~/…`. The Files settings tab (`FilesSettingsView`, bound to `SettingsStore.files*` keys and bridged to `FileSearchSettings` by `FileSearchIntegration`) adds scope, content search, result limit, default action, inline results, extra folders, and excluded folders.

## PhotonNotes

Raycast-Notes-style floating notes. One markdown file per note in
`~/Library/Application Support/Photon/Notes/`; the first non-blank line is the title. No cloud, no accounts.

| Type | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `NotesController` (public) | Facade the app uses: show / toggle / hide, create, open, delete, preferences, `noteSummaries()` for the launcher. Owns the store, the current note, and autosave. |
| `NoteStore` | Directory-backed CRUD. Files are named after creation time (`Note 2026-09-14 at 03.12.45.md`) and never renamed, so launcher frecency stays stable. Writes are atomic; `rescan()` diffs modification date + size so external edits are picked up when the window becomes key. Delete moves to the Trash. |
| `NotesWindow` / `NotesPanel` | Non-activating vibrancy `NSPanel` (titled, closable, resizable, transparent titlebar). Width is fixed at 680 pt (`NotesLayout`); height is user-resizable. HUD material sits behind a clear markdown editor, a character-count footer, and a **T** format control. Overlays: notes switcher (⌘P), actions palette (⌘K), format bar. Deeplinks are `photon://note/<id>`. Frame autosave `PhotonNotesWindow.v039`. |
| `NotesWindow+Toolbar` | Trailing toolbar: command palette (`command`), browse notes (`list.bullet.rectangle`), new note (`plus`). |
| `MarkdownFormat` / `NoteAction` | Pure edits for headings, emphasis, lists, links, and list-item move; ⌘K catalog (New / Duplicate / Browse / Find / Copy / Deeplink / Export / Format). |
| `MarkdownTextView` + `MarkdownTextStyler` | `NSTextView` (TextKit 1, plain text) styled from `MarkdownStyler` spans inside `NSTextStorageDelegate.didProcessEditing` (`NotesWindow+Editor.swift`). Content stays plain markdown; only attributes change. The first non-blank line gets the `.title` look (1.7× the body size, bold, extra paragraph spacing) layered over its markdown spans. 18 pt container insets. Clicking `[ ]` toggles it, Return continues lists. |
| `MarkdownStyler` (pure) | Line-based span computation: headings, bold / italic, inline code, fenced code, bullet and numbered lists, checkboxes. `titleSpan(in:)` marks the first non-blank line; `editAffectsTitle(_:in:)` tells the editor when an edit near the top needs a full pass. Otherwise restyling is paragraph-local unless the document contains a fence. |
| `NoteSidebarRow` (pure) / `NoteSidebarModel` / `NoteSidebarView` | Sidebar rows (title, snippet or "No additional text", Notes-style date: time today, "Yesterday", weekday within a week, else numeric) sorted newest first; the model bridges the SwiftUI `List(selection:)` to the controller and distinguishes user selection from programmatic updates. |
| `Debouncer` (pure) | Autosave coalescing (0.6 s) with an injectable scheduler for tests. Flushes on note switch, hide, resign key, and termination. |
| `NoteQuery` (pure) | Launcher grammar: `notes`, `note`, `n <text>`, `note <text>`, `notes <text>` list notes; anything else only matches the fixed "Notes" and "New Note" commands. |
| `NotesProvider` | `CommandProvider`: `notes.open`, `notes.new`, and `note:<id>` results. |

App-side wiring lives in `Sources/Photon/Notes/NotesIntegration.swift`: it maps `SettingsStore` (font size, float, open on launch, optional hotkey) onto `NotesPreferences`, registers the toggle hotkey as `HotkeyManager.HotkeyID.notes` (id 3), and exposes the provider that `AppRuntime` registers. `HotkeyManager` supports several hotkeys keyed by id; the launcher keeps id 1 and the original `register(combo:)` / `onPressed` API.

## Process shape

- `PhotonApp` is a SwiftUI `@main` app with `NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`.
- `LSUIElement` plus an explicit `.accessory` activation policy keep it out of the Dock. `StatusItemController` owns the `NSStatusItem` and its launcher, clipboard, notes, settings, and quit menu.
- `HotkeyManager` wraps Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`. The default shortcut is `Cmd+Space`. After the first-run sequence, Photon compares that shortcut to Spotlight (`com.apple.symbolichotkeys`, id 64) and shows guidance if they collide.
- The first-run sequence is a borderless transparent overlay (`Phase1Panel`) on the main display at screen-saver level, covering the menu bar and Dock. The desktop stays visible under a dim, with a blue haze and twinkling stars. A beam travels to center, then the Photon icon and the Sora wordmark rest until a click or Return. Timings live in `Phase1Metrics`. Sora is bundled under `Resources/Fonts` and registered at launch. `hasCompletedPhase1Onboarding` gates it, so earlier tours see this once. Settings > General shows it again. While the native parity harness is attached, the overlay opens already resting and dismisses without waiting on the beam. It does not request permissions.
- `LauncherPanelController` owns a non-activating floating `NSPanel`. Its content view is Liquid Glass (`NSGlassEffectView`) when that class exists, otherwise an `NSVisualEffectView` (`.popover`, `.behindWindow`, always active) clipped to a 12 pt continuous corner radius, with the SwiftUI `LauncherView` on top. The panel is created at launch so the hotkey only has to order it front. Esc and losing key focus hide it. Running a command hides Photon first and does **not** restore the previous app, so `ForegroundActivation` can bring the target above everything (`yieldActivation` plus `activateIgnoringOtherApps`). The panel has a command list, a clipboard session (`LauncherSession.clipboard`), and protocol-based feature modes (`LauncherMode`; file search today).
- Panel size: `LauncherLayout` (PhotonCore) is the single source of the metrics (56 pt search field, 40 pt rows, 10 visible, 32 pt footer, width presets 620 / 760 / 860). Empty-query recommendations keep the 760×502 frame and scroll the full catalog; Down/Up clamp instead of wrapping. A Suggestions section lists applications by local open count (`LauncherRanking`); files, notes, panes, and commands stay out of that section. Running dots stay on open apps wherever they sit. `LauncherViewModel` publishes a `LauncherContent` (`.searchOnly` for an empty query in compact mode, `.recommendations` for the Down-to-reveal list, `.rows(n)` for typed results, or `.fullHeight` for expanded file search and other `LauncherMode` views); the controller resizes the window from it with the top edge fixed, and `LauncherView` sizes itself from the same value, so the two never disagree. Click-and-drag anywhere on the panel repositions it after a small slop so row and button clicks still work. Live drag tracks `NSEvent.mouseLocation` in screen space so the window follows the pointer; dotted snap guides sit on the panel's left and right edges when it is centred, and the panel snaps when its midpoint is between those guides. Vertical placement persists. Files and clipboard detail panes reserve a footer-safe inset so metadata cannot paint over shortcuts. `LauncherRow` maps a `Command` to what a row shows (title, optional secondary detail, icon). Settings > Appearance (`launcherShowsSuggestions`, `launcherPanelWidth`, `appearance`) reach the launcher as a `LauncherPreferences` value; `appearance` is applied to `NSApp.appearance`.
- `HotkeyManager` registers several Carbon hotkeys keyed by id: `1` is the launcher, `2` opens clipboard history, `3` toggles the notes window (off by default), and `add(combo:handler:)` hands out ids from `1000` for features with a dynamic number of shortcuts (app hotkeys, window commands).
- Settings is a Photon-styled window: the same Liquid Glass / vibrancy panel chrome, 12 pt continuous corners, and type as the launcher (not a System Settings clone). Sidebar rows match launcher selection chrome. `⌘,` is wired through the Photon menu, the status item, and a local key monitor so it works while the launcher is key. Panes: General, Appearance, Clipboard, Notes, Files, Keybinds, About. Keybinds lists installed and running apps for shortcut assignment. `PHOTON_DEBUG=1` enables cheap `PhotonTiming` logs for launcher show/search and Files search.

## Clipboard history (`PhotonClipboard`)

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `ClipboardItem`, `ClipboardCapture`, `ClipboardSettings` | Value types. An item has a primary kind (`text`, `link`, `image`, `file`) plus optional secondary representations (RTF next to text, an image rendition next to text). |
| `ClipboardHistory` | Pure rules: newest first, duplicates collapse into one entry that moves to the top (by FNV-1a content hash), `prune` drops expired unpinned items then the oldest unpinned items over the limit. Pinned items never expire. |
| `ClipboardSearch` | Ranking for the clipboard view: every token must match title, body, file paths, source app, or kind; exact title hits outrank body hits, which outrank fuzzy hits; small recency and pinned bonuses. Empty query lists pinned first. |
| `ClipboardStore` | Actor. `index.json` (Codable `[ClipboardItem]`) plus `blobs/<uuid>.txt|.rtf|.png` under `~/Library/Application Support/Photon/Clipboard/`. Text up to 16 KB is inline; longer text and all images/RTF are blobs. No third-party dependencies. |
| `PasteboardMonitor` | Polls `NSPasteboard.general.changeCount` every 0.3 s on a utility queue. Skips `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` / `TransientType`, excluded frontmost apps, and Photon's own writes. |
| `ClipboardPaster` | Writes an item back (string, URL, RTF, PNG + TIFF, or file URLs) and sends `Cmd+V` via `CGEvent` when `AXIsProcessTrusted()`. |
| `ClipboardManager` | `@MainActor` façade: publishes items and storage size, applies settings, paste/copy, pin, delete, clear. |
| `ClipboardProvider` | The launcher command "Clipboard History" and the `cb ` / `clipboard ` prefix. Running it switches the panel into clipboard mode instead of closing it. |
| `ClipboardHistoryViewModel` / `ClipboardLauncherRow` / `ClipboardLauncherFooter` | Clipboard mode in the launcher: compact panel sizing, launcher-style rows (type icon, snippet, relative time), footer mode label and key hints. Return pastes (or copies, per setting), Cmd+Return copies, Cmd+P pins, Cmd+Delete deletes, Cmd+Shift+Delete clears after an inline confirmation, Esc goes back. |

`AppRuntime` creates one `ClipboardManager`, hands it to `LauncherPanelController.attachClipboard`, registers the provider, and mirrors `SettingsStore` into `ClipboardSettings` through `onClipboardChange`. The Clipboard settings tab (`ClipboardSettingsView`) binds to `SettingsStore` and reads storage size from the manager.

## PhotonKeybinds

`KeybindsController` (`@MainActor`, an `ObservableObject` the Keybinds tab observes) owns everything and is driven by one value, `KeybindsConfiguration`, which `SettingsStore` persists as JSON (`keybindsConfiguration`). `apply(_:)` is idempotent and runs after every settings change.

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `KeyShortcut` / `KeyModifiers` | Key code + modifiers. `⌃⌥⇧⌘` together is the Hyper key (`isHyper`, shown as `✦`). Parses `hyper+left`, `cmd+shift+k`, `⌃⌥⇧⌘Return`; converts to Carbon and `CGEventFlags` masks. Pure. |
| `WindowAction` / `WindowLayout` | The 19 window commands and their frame math (grid cells, translate between displays, fit, screen lookup, coordinate flip). Pure, bottom-left coordinates. |
| `KeybindsConfiguration` | Hyper key settings, app hotkeys, window bindings, conflict detection. Pure. |
| `AppHotkeyCatalog` | Merges installed apps, running apps, and saved shortcuts into the Settings list. Pure. |
| `HIDKeyMapping` / `HIDKeyRemapper` | The `hidutil` `UserKeyMapping` format (pure parser and JSON argument) and the process that runs `/usr/bin/hidutil` to map the chosen key to F18 and back. Photon only ever removes its own entries. |
| `HyperKeyEngine` | Session `CGEventTap` on the main run loop. Swallows F18 (and Caps Lock when it is the Hyper source), adds the four modifier flags to keys typed while it is held, dispatches keys that have a Hyper shortcut, and runs the tap behaviour (nothing / Escape / Caps Lock via `IOHIDSetModifierLockState`) on a quick press. Caps Lock as Hyper forces the lock state off on key down/up and `flagsChanged` so typing with Hyper cannot leave Caps Lock on. Re-enables itself when macOS disables the tap. |
| `WindowManager` | Accessibility API: frontmost app's focused window, `kAXPosition`/`kAXSize` (set size, position, size again; `AXEnhancedUserInterface` off while moving), multi-display via `NSScreen.visibleFrame`, per-window restore history. |
| `AppActivator` | App hotkey behaviour: hide when frontmost, otherwise launch or focus through `NSWorkspace`. |
| `AccessibilityPermission` | `AXIsProcessTrusted(WithOptions)`, `CGPreflightListenEventAccess`, System Settings deep links. |
| `CapsLockState` | Reads and clears the Caps Lock lock via IOHIDSystem while Caps Lock is Hyper. |
| `KeybindsProvider` | Puts the window commands in the launcher (`window:<action>` ids). |

Shortcut routing: plain combinations go through the app's `HotkeyManager` (Carbon) via the `GlobalHotkeyRegistrar` protocol the app implements; Hyper combinations fire from the event tap while the Hyper key is held and are also registered with Carbon so pressing the four modifiers by hand works. While a recorder is active the controller pauses dispatch so bound shortcuts can be re-recorded.

Safety: the HID remap is only installed after the event tap exists, is removed on quit, disable, permission loss, or failure, is cleaned up on the next launch after a crash, and is never persistent (macOS drops it at logout). Nothing in the module prompts for Accessibility except a one-time first-run alert and explicit user actions on the Keybinds tab.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and pushes to `develop` / `main`:

| Job | Runner | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `branch-name` | ubuntu-latest | Enforces `feature/GH-<n>-*`, `bug/GH-<n>-*`, `chore/*`, `docs/*`, `release/*` (passes for `develop`/`main` themselves). |
| `lint` | macos-latest | `swiftformat --lint` and `swiftlint lint --strict`. |
| `test` | macos-latest | `swift test` (PhotonCoreTests, PhotonAppsTests, PhotonClipboardTests, PhotonNotesTests, PhotonFilesTests, PhotonKeybindsTests). |
| `build` | macos-latest | `Scripts/package_app.sh`, uploads `Photon.app` (as a `ditto` zip so permissions and the signature survive). |
| `smoke` | macos-latest | Downloads that zip, records `sw_vers` / SDK, runs the crash/liveness smoke check, then launches the packaged app through `Scripts/check-native-parity.sh`. The native harness posts real global hotkeys (including ⌘,), mouse, typing, arrows, and appearance changes; it asserts process activation policy, status-menu presence, `NSPanel` style/frame, Settings visibility, launched-app frontmost, `CGWindow` bounds, compact clipboard lifecycle, and application icon resolution. |

`branch-name`, `lint`, `build`, `test`, and `smoke` are the required status checks. SwiftPM `.build` is cached per job.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on `v*.*.*` tags and, as a dry run, on `workflow_dispatch`. See [releasing.md](releasing.md).
