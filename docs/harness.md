# Parity harness

Photon has two required test layers.

`Scripts/check-harness.sh` runs focused Swift fixtures for compact launcher geometry, anchored resizing and snap math, running-app ranking, clipboard filtering/persistence, app and System Settings metadata, `ember` file ranking and home scope, notes, configurable shortcuts, app-hotkey catalog merge, Caps Lock Hyper suppression, and window layouts. CI also runs the complete `swift test` suite.

`Scripts/check-native-parity.sh build/Photon.app` runs only on macOS and tests the packaged application as a process. It:

- verifies `LSUIElement`, `.accessory` activation policy, a visible `NSStatusItem`, and its menu;
- opens clipboard history with the real global `Cmd+Shift+V` registration;
- inspects the actual `LauncherPanel` style, traffic-light state, floating level, frame, and corresponding `CGWindow`;
- drags the search field, list padding, preview, and footer with real mouse events (after click slop), checking free X/Y movement, guide-span center snapping, stable frames, guides, and preserved search/row clicks;
- cycles clipboard rows, validates complete text and image detail with Vision OCR, and pastes a unique sentinel into a real helper text field;
- drives the controlled `NSOpenPanel` adapter from ungranted through persisted security-scoped access without hiding the Files panel, resumes `ember`, relaunches the packaged app, and verifies the grant still works;
- opens empty Files to seeded PDF/image recents, OCR-validates that metadata dates do not overlap footer shortcuts, moves selection with Up/Down, and OCR-validates Quick Look previews and metadata before querying `ember`;
- opens the launcher through a non-system-reserved configured hotkey and verifies application bundle icon resolution;
- changes the system appearance while Photon remains running and verifies both effective appearance and resolved colors update;
- attempts Accessibility window introspection when the runner grants it, with `CGWindow` as the non-TCC fallback.

The app-side reporter and controlled adapters are inert unless `PHOTON_NATIVE_PARITY_REPORT_PATH` is set. The harness also sets `PHOTON_ISOLATED_DATA_ROOT`, so it never reads or modifies the normal Photon profile. `showOnboarding` opens the Phase 1 overlay already resting (no beam) and `dismissOnboarding` fades it out. `advanceOnboarding` and `showOnboardingHotkey:default` are accepted and do nothing.

`Scripts/screenshots.sh` captures every real built scenario in light and dark appearance. `Scripts/check-screenshot-compact.sh` rejects traffic-light-like title chrome and oversized empty-launcher captures.
